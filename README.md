## 👩‍🔬 About Me

I am a passionate **Data Analyst** and **Bioinformatician** currently working at **ANSES** (French Agency for Food, Environmental, and Occupational Health & Safety), specializing in swine virology and immunology. My work focuses on bioinformatics analyses and large-scale data correlations, contributing to the study of **Swine Influenza Viruses (swIAV)**.

- 🧬 I have experience in **phylogenetics**, **genomics**, and the analysis of surveillance data, especially as part of the **PIGIE European project (ERA-Net ICRAD)**.
- 🔬 I am skilled in **bioinformatics**, **data science**, and using **computational tools** to analyze viral sequences and visualize complex biological datasets.
- 🎓 I am also preparing for a PhD focused on understanding the dynamics and evolution of swine influenza viruses in France, building upon my research at ANSES.

## 💻 Technologies & Tools

Here are some of the tools and technologies I use in my work:

### Programming Languages
- Python
- R
- Bash/Shell

### Bioinformatics Tools
- Biopython
- Bioconductor (R)
- BEDtools
- BLAST
- SAMtools

### Data Analysis & Visualization
- Pandas, NumPy, SciPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2
- Jupyter Notebooks

### Machine Learning & Statistical Modeling
- scikit-learn
- Bayesian Statistics

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- Advanced phylogenetic and phylodynamic techniques, particularly for **swIAV**.
- Bayesian approaches for sequence data analysis and phylogeographic studies.

## 🔬 My Research Interests

- **Swine Influenza Virus Phylogenetics**: Analyzing the evolutionary relationships of swIAV and understanding how viruses spread and evolve.
- **Epidemiological Data Analysis**: Using farm surveillance data to study the transmission and control of viral infections.
- **Phylogeography**: Investigating the geographic spread of viruses using computational methods, focusing on **Bayesian analyses**.

## 🌍 International Collaboration

As a member of the **European Swine Influenza Network (ESFLU)**, I am currently applying for the **Working Group 2 on Sequence Analysis** training to expand my expertise in **swIAV sequence alignment**, **maximum-likelihood trees**, and **Bayesian phylogenetic approaches**. This training is crucial for enhancing my research capabilities and will support my future PhD endeavors.
